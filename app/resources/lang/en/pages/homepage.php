                anything it can that doesn’t belong physically and mentally. This is often experienced as random thoughts,
                images, and such flowing by as it cleans everything out, much like defragmenting a computer.',

                it reveals the origins of your suffering and continues to teach you by showing you the truth. In short, it
                helps you release patterns, memories, and traumas to free you from them – so you can be the true you. After the ceremony,
                Iboga continues to help you by improving mindfulness and promoting neuroplasticity so you can create a new,

                healing experience to fit their specific needs – in the way they will best understand.'
