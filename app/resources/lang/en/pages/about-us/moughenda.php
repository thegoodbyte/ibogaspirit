                 but it wasn\'t until the age of 8 that he took his very first big dose of medicine and started training with his grandfather,
                 Bwiti Shaman 9th generation. It took about twenty years of intensive training and four major initiations to earn the title of a
                 Bwiti shaman. Once he graduated as a shaman, he continued to work closely with his grandfather for the next ten years.',
