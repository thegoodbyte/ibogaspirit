                 I studied traditional
                 Iboga healing with a 10th generation shaman directly in Gabon, Central West Africa. I come from West Bohemia - Pils district -
                 but I have lived in North America for over the past 20 years and practice Bwiti healing mostly in Mexico.
                 Now I offer Iboga ceremonies here in Czech Republic as well.',
        'par_2'=> 'I fell in love with the Bwiti and Iboga tradition of medicine because it teaches us our inner truth and
                 how beautiful, simple and uncomplicated our life is and can be.
                 The Iboga plant is both a healer and a teacher.
                 Iboga helped me when I was going through a traumatic time in my life.
                 Before this period I used to be very successful and happy, but then a traumatic event sent me into
                 false assumptions and ideas, anxiety, fear and panic attacks.
                 I worked a lot on myself - autosuggestion, various Toltec shamanic practices, courses from Tony Robins,
                 law of attraction, fortune tellers, daily meditation, etc. I slowly continued
                  but I was getting nowhere',

                 My heart was open again, not only to love others, but also to love myself.

                 amazing plant.

        'par_6'=> 'After so many wonderful experiences, I wanted to help heal others as well, so I decided to learn from a shaman who had trained my own healer.
                  I returned to Gabon and trained with a shaman, Moughenda Mikala, a 10th generation shaman in the Missoko Bwiti tradition',
