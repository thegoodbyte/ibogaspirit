                important part of their lives, that it is used as the initiation into the tradition and is consumed regularly at ceremonies.',

                split into different sects, each still holding many of the same traditions.
                The tradition began with the Babongs of Gabon, who are also known as Pygmies, however,

            Iboga and ultimately Iboga influenced and inspired all Bwiti. Almost every aspect of Missoko
            today\'s tradition is created by the spirit of Iboga and Iboga is their main sacrament. Babongo people kept
            the sacrament of Iboga among themselves and for a very long time they kept it secret to protect it. Finally
            they shared it with others and it is now one of the main spiritual traditions of Gabon.'

            rench missionaries several hundred years ago. Missoko Bwiti has no Christian influence and is
