    This master plant teacher was used by the Pygmies, traditionally called Babongo; known to be one of the oldest African tribes. These tribes lived primitively, as hunters and gatherers where money holds no value. Some of these tribes are continuing to live the traditional way today and can be found deep in the jungles of Africa. The Babongo tribe used Iboga for thousands of years for ritualistic and healing purposes and then passed down the knowledge to the Bwiti tradition and its tribes in Gabon, Africa.

    <h4>8 DAY IBOGA RETREAT SCHEDULE</h4>
    <h4>DAY ONE Welcome Ceremony</h4>
    A day for guests to meet each other, connect with providers, settle in and make themselves comfortable. At dark, we gather around the fire and share. Our providers speak about their own experiences with Iboga, the history of the plant and the Bwiti, wisdom about how to get the most out of the experience, and discuss the session schedule and general retreat information.


    <div class = "row">
        <h4>DAY TWO First Iboga Ceremony</h4>
        <p>
        Early in the day, providers have a private, one-on-one chat with each guest to discuss life intentions and questions for the medicine. A late lunch is served, after which guests fast for the remainder of the day. At dark, there is a group Iboga Fire Ceremony, where traditional Bwiti music is played and wisdom teachings are imparted.
        Guests take the medicine, which is administered as both Iboga Root Bark and its Total Alkaloid (TA) extraction. It is important to have both forms of the medicine available. Some people have a higher tolerance and it can get difficult to get enough root bark powder in them to send them deep and get what they need. Therefore we have the TA on hand so everyone has the opportunity to get what they came for.
        </p>
        <p>
        We talk about Life and other important teachings that come from the Bwiti tradition. This tradition is actually the study of Life itself. After about an hour or so, Iboga is given to each person who is participating in the ceremony. For most people, it takes about an hour until they begin to ‘feel the medicine’. Once someone is feeling the Iboga, they are escorted to a mattress in the ceremony area where they will spend the rest of the night.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our staff is present throughout the ceremony to help people with their needs, some water to drink,
            more iboga if needed, help getting to and from the nearby bathroom, purging (vomiting), or offering direction as needed. We create a very safe environment for you so you can focus on your experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        When the time is right, we will begin the process of guiding you into yourself. This process has been used by the Bwiti for many generations. By guiding you, you can get the answers to any questions you may have about your life. You may be able to see and converse with your own spirit (your soul / higher self). Many people are able to ‘travel’ spiritually throughout the world. It is also possible to make contact with deceased family and friends using this process. During this guided journey we will also ‘open’ your third eye (spiritual vision) using special herbs and barks prepared by the Pygmies.
        </p>
        <p>
        The remainder of the night is spent journeying in the ceremony area, until sunrise, when guests are taken back to their respective rooms.

        <h4>DAY THREE Discovery Day</h4>
        <p>
            This day is all about introspection, insight, release, and acceptance. Commonly, so much happens during the active
            Iboga journey itself (day two), that many of the insights and processing of that journey are realized on
            Discovery Day. As the intensity of the medicine settles, Iboga’s gifts are presented. It is common to
            experience intuitive messages and deep personal knowingness in the stillness of day three —
            so it is extremely important to preserve that repose by staying off of phones, computers and other
            electronic devices. By removing distractions, we keep ourselves open to receiving messages. Devices and
            distractions block Iboga from continuing its work.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "row">
        <h4>DAY FOUR Offsite Excursion & Spiritual Shower</h4>
        <p>
            By this day, guests are feeling more grounded in their bodies, the mind is quieter, and the body is lighter. Lessons are still coming, but guests feel ready to venture outside of the retreat grounds to witness the teachings. This day is necessary. Some retreats do 4 or 5 night retreats with 2 ceremonies. If you would be ready for another ceremony one day after recovering then you may not have been given a sufficient dose of medicine.
            Day four is an important time to reconnect with nature. Iboga leaves us open and sensitive to the energies around us. This is the time to allow nature to fill the spaces that are opened up. And the purest form of intelligent wisdom and true resonance can only come from the Earth.
            The day is spent outdoors, at one of our favorite beach spots or at the hot springs. Guests are able to connect to the profoundly healing energy of plants, trees — and most importantly, the ocean, the ultimate cleanser of what does not serve us.
            Following the beach or hot springs, guests are given a Spiritual Shower, which is held in traditional Bwiti ceremony. Because Iboga has dislodged deeply stuck emotions, beliefs, traumas and patterns, the purpose of the Spiritual Shower is to fully release those things. In the space created by their absence, guests can invite their deepest dreams and wishes into being. The spiritual shower is done at a local river.
            Each person must bring a change of clothes to this ceremony (which they must be comfortable leaving behind). The physical shedding of old clothing is symbolic of the spiritual shedding of old patterns and traumas.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Spiritual Shower is an ancient African ceremony. We work with plants and nature’s water spirits to call in positive, self-serving patterns and release negative, self-sabotaging patterns. The depths to which we can release negativity in this ceremony are limitless — we are even able to access and shed negativity from our ancestral lineage. It is all able to be washed away, cleansed and renewed.

        <h4>DAY FIVE Onsite Activities & Second Iboga Ceremony</h4>
        <p>
            ceremony under palapaDuring the day, guests have the option to schedule in-house massages. Wonderful massage therapists come to the center and perform a full body massages for our guests. Many guests have said it was the best massage of their life..

            Group integration circle before lunch.  Light nature walks later in the afternoon.

            In the evening, we hold our second Iboga ceremony. Around the fire, as we begin to take the medicine, guests are invited (but not required) to share about their first ceremony. The things that were cleared out during the first journey will not need to be addressed again; the second Iboga ceremony allows us to move even deeper inward.

            The iboga experience will be different in some way each time we have the medicine. Guests should be trust the medicine to do its job. We just have to know what we want from the experience.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "row">
        <h4>DAY SIX Discovery Day</h4>
        <p>
            What transpires on the second Discovery Day is much like the first; Iboga’s wisdom and teachings reveal themselves as its ceremonial energy begins to quiet. We spend time without distractions, exploring the peace and truth of our own spirits’ stillness.
            DAY SEVEN Offsite Excursion & Closing Talk
            Our day is spent soaking up the healing sunlight and cleansing ocean energy at another beach along the coast.
            In the evening, we gather as a group and enjoy the benefits the medicine. Wisdom about taking our new found
            gifts and taking the lessons we have learned to create the life we want. By this point everyone is realizing
            the gifts of the medicine and what they have released from the experience. 2 deep full dose experiences with
            the medicine is profound and for many it is enough iboga to last them a lifetime.

        <h4>DAY EIGHT Departure Day</h4>
        <p>
            Breakfast and lunch are served at the center while guests wait to be taken to the airport to board their departing flights or on to the next destination in Costa Rica.
            Everything offered during our 8-day retreats is optional; if guests do not feel comfortable participating in certain scheduled activities, they may opt out. It’s all about empowered choice, and the choice to partake is always up to the individual.
        <p>
    </div>

    <div class = "row">
        <h4>Other activities</h4>
    Working with Iboga is incredibly powerful and amazing things will happen, but it’s also important for your wellness to have some activities that make it easier to relax and enjoy yourself. We have various activities that we offer to give you a little break.
    on-site activities: bird & and animal watching, plenty of space for yoga, hiking trails and walks to the river that runs behind the Iboga Wellness property.
