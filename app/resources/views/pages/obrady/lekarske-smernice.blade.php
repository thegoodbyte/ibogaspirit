            <p>Iboga is an incredibly safe medicine, as long as the user has a healthy heart and is not using any substances. The vast majority of any health implications have been a result of use for drug detoxing purposes or situations where a heart condition was irresponsibly overlooked. Conversely Iboga actually greatly assists in the overall improvement of our physical health, not only in it’s ability to remover toxicity but also because we store an enormous amount of emotional pain in our cellar memory. When the suffering in the mind begins to ease, the body lets go and vice versa.

                At Awaken Your Soul we do not work with anyone who is physically dependent on any substance. Every guest is required to have an Electrocardiogram (EKG) in advance as well as a liver panel if there is a history of liver issues or severe alcohol abuse. The EKG can be done with your doctor or on site here. Our doctors are specially trained to be looking at specifics in the EKG that are particular to Iboga and cannot be read by another doctor.

                Our doctors are emergency room trained and are on site for every ceremony and on call throughout our weekly retreats. Our guests are required to fill out a detailed health form sighting basic physical and mental health history which we pay close attention to. We have one  facilitator to every 2.5 guests and we are very hands one, especially during the ceremony and discovery day (day following the ceremony).

                Costa Rica is a very safe and easy country to travel in, there is no military and the country slogan is “Pura Vida” meaning Pure Life. The water is safe to drink, the air is impeccably clean and the jungle where we live is quite safe with only one type of snake to be mindful of. The Terceopello is often easily spotted and we have seen only a handful in the years that we have been here.

                Working with this medicine is the experience of a lifetime and a very safe one at that!

                Soul
                Once you decide to participate in an Iboga ceremony the Spirit of Iboga starts working with you. If you need financial help, ask Iboga for it and Iboga will help you make it happen.

                Meditation is a powerful tool to begin to strengthen the muscle that quiets your mind and turns you inward, connecting you with your soul. Doing this ahead of time will prepare you for ceremony when the best thing to do is to quiet your mind and follow the music.

                Trust your soul if you feel an intuitive call to the medicine.

                Preparing Questions For Iboga
                Questions? What?

                Yes! During ceremony, once you’ve ingested enough medicine, you can ask Iboga absolutely anything. Iboga connects you with your soul, your truth- where all the answers are.

                Once this connection is made, a meditation practice back at home will strengthen both your relationship with Iboga and with your Soul, to support you to be able to regularly hear your intuition, trust yourself, and answer all of your own questions- always.

            <p>Step One
                Life Overview
                When preparing questions, we recommend taking out your notebook and drawing a line down the centre of the page.

                On the left side, write down all of the things that you currently don’t like about your life.

                On the right side of the line, directly across from each one, write down what you want it to look like.

                For example, if there are struggles in your romantic relationship. On the right side write, my partner and I are struggling. Directly across write what you want it to be, for example, my partner and I are in a healthy relationship.

                From here, you can create your questions. For example,

                How can I have a healthy relationship? </p>


            <p>
                Step Two
                Get to The Root
                The medicine will help you to access subconscious memories. Everything has a root cause. When we go back to the FIRST time that something happened, we see the truth- that unhealthy, disserving mind programming from childhood. And when you see the truth, you heal it and you set yourself free.

                With every issue in your chart, you could ask,

                When did it start?

                When did the issues with my partner begin?

                If you know specific issues, ask specific questions- the more specific the better.

                For example, when was the first time I experienced poor communication?
            </p>

            <p>
                Step Three
                Do Things Differently
                Now that you’ve healed an old wound, it’s time to create a new habit so that you can begin to generate new results. Ask the medicine how you can do things differently.

                How can I change it?

                How can I have better communication with my partner?

                Like Michael says, become the captain of your own ship! And as per Coby Kozlowski, when you change the course of a ship by one degree, you end up in a completely new destination.

                But first you need to realize that you are in control to make new choices- and this is the potential of Iboga.

                You should stop using any medication that is not necessary for life support. This includes any pharmaceutical products that work to suppress symptoms. It is necessary to stop using medications as much as two to three weeks before and after taking Iboga. Most of the medications may reduce Iboga’s healing potential or alter its effects. Some of the medications could also be extremely dangerous in combination with Iboga. For your safety don’t book a retreat if you are under any psychiatric medication. We recommend you to speak to your doctor and see  all options to quit all psychiatric medications for a minimum of two months. Iboga can be very dangerous if combined with psychiatric medications. PLEASE CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS!!!

                Is important to trust that the Iboga has the potential to cleanse and detox the body and mind, so there is no necessary diets, nor detox. However we are NOT A CLINIC NOR REHAB AND WE DO NOT OFFER DRUG DETOX, if you suffer from drug addiction we recommend you to check in to a detox clinic before coming to our retreat (we do drug tests before each ceremony). Please check below the drugs to be avoided with Iboga page.

We treat the safety of our guests as of utmost importance and ensure that all measures, including 24-hour supervision, are adopted as and where necessary.
