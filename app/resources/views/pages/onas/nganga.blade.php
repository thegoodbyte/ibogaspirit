                Traditional Missoko Bwiti IBOGA Provider, Spiritual Psychotherapist, Life Coach,
                Holistic Practitioner
                When you deal with private and personal issues of the heart, mind, and soul, engaging with a teacher who is authentic and intelligent while also being fun-loving and down-to-earth is crucial. That is Sherry's greatest gift as a teacher. Her wild sense of humour, combined with a direct approach, helps to challenge her clients in a positive way, creating a comfortable and safe atmosphere for those who are ready to receive the healing they desire.



                Born and raised in a small Canadian country town and with an active lifestyle that includes walking, dance, and yoga, she naturally responds to nature and all the creatures that exist in it, especially cats. Sherry has been on her own personal healing journey and has done an extensive amount of work around healing her own trauma and abuse on a personal level, which has led her to a greater understanding, self-compassion and empowerment when working with her clients. Her journey has led to extensive world travel through Canada, Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and America, in search of key aspects of natural healing techniques and remedies for her own development and those around her.



                Over the last 20 years,  she has kept up with her personal work/healing and has obtained diplomas as a Holistic Practitioner, Life Coach and Spiritual Psychotherapy program from the Transformational Arts College, Toronto, Canada.



                Since 2018 she has studied  a sacred African plant-based medicine IBOGA and the tradition it comes from; Bwiti tradition which means the study of life.  Sherry has spent over 6 months in Africa over the years continuing her studies with plant medicine Iboga.   She graduated her Psycho-Spiritual Providership in 2019 and Detox Providership in 2020.  From 2018-2020 she worked closely with a team and mentor and helped open up a center in Mexico 2019-2020.  This, along with vast experience in the services and corporate industries, her private practice enables her to follow her passion and dreams of helping others heal and continue her work with IBOGA by offering sacred plant medicine ceremonies and retreats for individuals, couples, and group sessions.



                Understanding the impact that trauma has on emotional, physical, and mental health, by identifying root causes of negative limiting beliefs, depression, and anxiety, and then releasing these old traumas of the past, you create room for solutions and inspire positive change to your present state of mind.



                "My biggest passions are helping others uncover their potential and find happiness. I want to support and celebrate all your successes. It is a high honour to walk alongside you, hold space for you as you heal, discover yourself, and create the life that you want."



                Sherry offers a range of modalities for an integrative and holistic approach in healing and coaching. Visit www.healyou.ca
