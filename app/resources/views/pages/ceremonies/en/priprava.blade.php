            <p>Begin The Process

                The changes often begin the moment we make the commitment to work with this medicine. Up to
                months in advance most notice that life begins to shift. In order to get the most of your experience
                we suggest some preparation in advance:
            </p>

            <p>
                Workbook~ A mandatory Iboga preparation workbook that we send upon booking that is designed to help
                you uncover some deeper truths. This workbook is for you first and foremost and also will help us
                guide you even further to achieve lasting results.
            </p>

            <p>
                Coaching~ We always suggest working with a coach or an energy healer in combination with the Iboga work.
                This is helpful with Iboga preparation but it is especially paramount in the integration process afterwards.
                Meeting with someone in advance can help establish a healthy support system for integration.
                Our Awaken Your Soul staff all use multiple methods of integration support for our own work.
                Check out some resources that we offer.
            </p>

            <p>
                The workbook and any coaching prep will help:
            </p>

            <p>
                Review aspects of your life/behaviors that you are ready to release
                Clarifying what you are looking to heal
                Create clear intentions about what you wish to discover about your life
                Give directives to cleanse the body & environment around you
                Prepare you to make lasting life changes
                Bring items stored in the subconscious into the conscious to be released
                Help to understand your programming and the subconscious mind
            </p>

            <p>
                Ultimately you are looking to:
            </p>

            <p>
                Surrender, be willing to be open to how the process unfolds
                Understand that whatever we expect will be completely different
                Be open to entering a state of complete vulnerability
                Be willing to look at uncomfortable aspects of your life (this helps them pass and heal)
                Open your heart and your mind
                Understand that trust in the medicine and in us increases the healing process on every level
                Committing to ceremony is an opportunity to address everything that has caused us suffering. While the
                past cannot be changed, the choice to make peace with it remains in our control, the power is not
                outside of us!
            </p>

            <p>
                Physical & Emotional Iboga Preparation~
            </p>

            <p>
                At least one week before your Iboga journey we encourage you to begin your preparation of the body,
                mind and spirit. The medicine works best with the clearest channel so the more work we do in
                advance the less “noise” and toxins the medicine needs to cut through. The more time you give yourself the better.
            </p>

            <p>
                Diet Before & After Iboga~ There is no “Iboga Diet” per-se but the cleaner we eat, the less we need
                to detox before the medicine can work it’s full magic. There is also a very strong correlation
                between the body/mind/soul connections. When we are conscious and mindful about what we put in our
                bodies, we tend to be more mindful about our thoughts, environments and the company we choose to keep.
                We find that many people after having a deep internal shift will also implement changes in their diet and vice versa.
                The more prep we can do in advance to “tune in” and clean up aspects of our lives, the deeper
                the medicine can go more quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Eat healthy, vibrant foods~ Iboga is a strong on the physical body so fasting or juicing exclusively
                is not recommended (though it is great to add juices to your eating schedule).
                Organic and minimally processed foods are best.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pastured & wild meats/seafood (unless already vegetarian or vegan)
                Hearty nourishing plant-based foods
                Lots of fruits and vegetables
                Grounding foods such as root vegetables, bone broth, soups/stews (especially after the retreat)
                Minimal to no sugar
                Remove any alcohol 7-14 days before (unless instructed for longer)
                Reduce caffeine (no more than 1 cup per day so as to avoid caffeine headaches the day of ceremony)
                Eliminate soda and other sugary beverages
                Drink a lot of filtered water (1 gallon per day +)
                Eliminate highly processed foods, especially with preservatives and artificial colors/flavors
                Medications & Supplements~ It is recommended to pause most medications when working with Iboga.
                Either they are contraindicated or will simply be flushed out by the medicine. Speak with us
                honestly before you book about anything that you are currently taking. This is for your safety,
                we cannot stress this enough.
            </p>

            <p>
                Physical Exercise~ If you have a normal routine 3-5 times a week continue this and perhaps add
                some extra time in nature if your practice is indoors. If you are not particularly active consider
                adding the following activities:
            </p>

            <p>
                Walks in nature, perhaps with a pet
                Gentle yoga, qi gong, tai chi
                Swimming, bike rides
                Detox Your Brain~ Reduce/eliminate your television, computer and social media time. We store a
                lot of programming in our subconscious from these sources and the clearer we are- the less Iboga
                has to move through before getting to the heart of what we are looking to receive from the medicine.
            </p>

            <p>
                Connect with your intentions~
                Get very clear on what it is you are looking to heal. Doing the workbook and with a preparation coach,
                therapist or healer can also assist in moving and clarifying a lot to begin to move some of the energy
                in advance to receive even more from the medicine during the retreat.
            </p>

            <p>
                When considering Iboga as a teacher, we must take the first step and ask ourselves, ‘Am I ready?’
            </p>

            <p>
                This means that we are willing to look deep inside our soul, to commit to taking back ownership of our
                minds and our lives, that we are ready to seek truth and break free from what is holding us back.
            </p>

            <p>
                Committing to this spiritual journey and setting our intentions is the beginning. But as our journey
                approaches, the mind, sensing imminent demise of its destructive ways, will play tricks and cause us to doubt.
            </p>

            <p>
                When these doubtful thoughts come, simply acknowledge them and let them pass. Be aware of the thoughts
                without reading into them, or attaching to them. It is okay that they exist. Thoughts will always exist,
                negative and positive. It is up to us to decide how much power to give them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Deep healing is not comfortable and it is not easy, but it works. Healing at the root happens when we
                surrender. It happens when we confront our fears. By confronting our shadows, we break through to our
                greatest possible light!

            Pre-Ceremony Preparation
            In the weeks before the upcoming iboga healing ceremony, you will need to prepare yourself physically,
            emotionally, mentally and spiritually.
        </p>

        <p>
            1. Get Your Medical Screening Done as Soon As Possible
            Get your EKG and liver panel as soon as possible. There are as small percentage of people that have a
            specific heart condition, called a prolonged QT rthym, that can put them in a high-risk group depending on
            how severe it is. IbogaSafe is a great resource on medical safety related to iboga and ibogaine. Most of
            the deaths related to iboga or ibogaine were due to the complications related to high-risk addiction patients
            who were taking higher “flood dose” of the iboga or ibogaine, which is much more than a person would take
            in a psycho-spiritual ceremony with the “holy wood”.
        </p>

        <p>
            <!-- https://entheonation.com/blog/iboga-preparation-guide/ -->
            4. Expand Your Understanding of Dis-ease & Healing
            Be open to experiencing healing on a holistic level that includes not only your physical well-being, but your emotional and spiritual health. In many tribal cultures it was believed that one of the keys to health in the community was for each person in the community to undergo a rite of passage, to perform a vision quest or pilgrimage when they came of age. This tradition was lost in Western culture and may be the reason why our modern civilization is plagued with psychological illness. In Bwiti culture, iboga was consumed as part of an initiation rite to help you face your darkness and fears, while receiving guidance from your ancestors.
        </p>

        <p>
            5. Reframe Your Understanding of Fear & Suffering
            The Bwiti believe that the only suffering that you experience with iboga medicine comes from your own ego. You can choose fight the medicine and continue the path of suffering; if you do that is a reflection of your approach to life. The suffering you experience during the journey is not created by the medicine, it is your ego projecting future suffering and therefore resisting what is happening the present moment. This medicine teaches you how to die, as well as how to truly live, by showing you how to navigate the depths of your psyche and heal the trauma that has been afflicting you, creating stories of limitation, since the moment you were born.
        </p>

        <p>
            MUST READ Iboga Medicine – Psychedelic Healing the Bwiti Way

            While consuming a psychedelic plant medicine that some have said is 100 times stronger than ayahuasca might seem like the scariest thing on the planet, iboga doesn’t have to be scary at all. Iboga is the vehicle that allows you to sit with yourself long enough to realize that thing you are afraid of is an illusion. This is the medicine that will wake you up to the holographic nature of life and awaken you to your avatar self.

            6. Exercise & Stretch
            If you are incredibly active, you might consider taking down your daily marathon or CorePower one notch during the days leading up to your journey. Focus on more yin/restorative activities such as yoga, stretching, hiking.

            Anything that increases your flexibility is going to be helpful. Gentle yoga is the best. Try get in some long, juicy stretches beforehand.

            It is beneficial to get a good massage to work out any kinks since you will be lying for extended time periods.

            The most important thing is rest up as much as you can beforehand. Get in some naps and try to avoid any late nights the few days up to the ceremony.

            NOTE: Do not take herbs any less than 24hrs before ceremony, as Iboga shamans say the Iboga does not like other medicinal herbs, psychoactive substances (including cannabis), and supplements to be in the system while it is working.

            During the Ceremony
            An iboga ceremony typically lasts 24 hours, with the most intense part of the journey lasting 8 hours. Some people may not be able to fall asleep up to 48 hours after they have taken the medicine.

            A traditional iboga initiation is led by a Nima, a Bwiti shaman. In the Bwiti tradition, one does not become a Nima by mastering how to facilitate an iboga ceremony from a technical standpoint. It is easy to learn how to play music or to prepare the fire or to lead someone on a guided journey. One cannot graduate to becoming a Nima until they have become completely whole themselves. The medicine will tell the Nima when the initiate has graduated. Many Nima have 10 to 20 years of experience working with the “holy wood”, which is equal to the level of study of a modern doctor.

            The music in ceremony is created using a variety of wisks, brooms, and one of the oldest instruments in recording human history; the Mougongo. According to Uwe Maas of Süster Strubelt, the polyrhythms in the Bwiti music helps to regulate one’s sense of time and heartbeat, assisting with psychedelic visions.

            Many people find the psychedelic experience so intense that they are unable to move. Expect to spend many hours lying still. Iboga medicine also is known to induce nausea, physical discomfort and purging. Here are some guidelines to help you optimize your iboga journey.

            1. Set Your Intention
            Meditation and intention are essential to guiding your journey! This is a deep soujourn into your inner psyche and having questions prepared will help to drive the journey and visions. Practice guided imagery of surrendering and letting go of who you are for the purpose of being psychologically and spiritually cleansed and even reborn. Be flexible with expectations about the experience because it is vastly different for all people. Iboga causes dreamlike visions but not for everyone. Although there is little to no medical risk, the experience can induce a sense of fear and a virtual or simulated near death experience. Psychologically surrendering versus holding on can minimize fear during the experience.

            2. Practice Meditation
            Remember to breathe! If the iboga experience feels overwhelming, slow down and focus on your breath. Experienced meditators will have an easier time maintaining calmness and balance, even during difficult times in the journey. If you have past experience with Vipassana meditation, you will be ahead of the game. The iboga experience is like a long meditation where the lines of reality and the dream may shift for you in a positive way.

            3. Use Essential Oils
            Essential oils are beneficial for calming and grounding. Lavender can be applied to the body for cooling and soothing. Bring some coconut oil or massage oil with you. You may become sensitive to synthetic fragrance and smell, so scented lotions are not recommended.
        </p>

            After the Ceremony
            The liver and adrenals can take a hit from the lack of sleep. Studies show that an effect of the medicine is an increase in ATP which fuels the mitochondria, so you might feel a little tired after but you will get a huge boost following.

            CBD helps calm the nervous system. I really like CBD Hemp Oil which does not contain any THC (the psychoactive part of cannabis). Recent studies have shown CBD oil’s impact on inflammation and pain in the body. If you are a fan of THC, it’s fine to take. However, taking smaller doses to integrate your experience is recommended.
        </p>

        <p>
            Post-Ceremony Integration
            This sacrament can release old trauma, and shift one’s understanding of self and the divine. Thus, it is a good idea to set aside time for self-reflection and meditation. Take it easy for the first 1-2 weeks afterwards as you will be sensitive to smell, sound, and intense environments.

            Bring a journal or voice recorder as you will likely experience increased awareness about your life, gain new insights and may wish to capture these. In the first part of the journey you will be fully immersed in the experience, however during the later stages or the morning after your iboga journey it will be progressively easier to record insights. Soak in your experience and write about it if you can, to retain as much as possible.

            When you arrive home have a trusted friend, coach, counselor or spiritual advisor to process the experience with. This sacrament can open up your psychological and energetic field so it is advantageous to surround yourself with people who are loving and at a empathetic in the days following. For example, avoid large crowds.

            Some people report difficulty sleeping the nights following and melatonin supplementation (~3mg at bedtime) or GABA can be beneficial in this regard.

            It’s important to note that iboga stays in your system for at least several weeks, so avoiding alcohol and stimulants will prolong the benefits of this work. It is best to avoid alcohol at least one month post, so you can fully integrate your experience. If you maximize the purification benefits, stay away for 3-6 months, you may see even more profound shifts in your life than the actual ceremony itself. Many report not even having a desire to drink, as the candida or emotional attachment tends to be completely eliminated by the medicine, reducing any cravings for sugar and carbohydrates.

            NOTE: If you plan on taking doing other ceremonial plant medicines, give at least a month in between for recovery and integration of your experience. This powerful plant spirit is still providing healing months after the ceremony and other medicines can interfere with the process. Many people report high levels of sensitivity to other psychoactive medicines post ceremony. Use caution specifically with recreational use of psychoactive medicines.

        How do I prepare for an Iboga ceremony?
        FAQ
        Health screening:
        </p>

        <p>
        Make sure you have reviewed your health history and disclosed all information to your Iboga Provider.  If you have certain health conditions, working with Iboga maybe unsafe.  Also, if you  are taking certain pharmaceuticals or other drugs, you should not take Iboga at the same time period.  We recommend everyone get an EKG to ensure you have a healthy heart prior to working with Iboga.
        </p>

        <p>
        Diet:

        There is no strict diet required to prepare for Iboga.  However we recommend a clean and healthy diet as much as possible leading up to your retreat.  A healthy and untaxed digestive system will allow you to better absorpb the medicine.  It also tends to reduce the occurance of purging via vommitting during your session.   Also, since the medicine won’t have to focus as much on cleaning and detoxing the body, it can more quickly get to the spiritual / psychological / emotional work wtih you.
        </p>

        <p>
        Prepare to Unplug:

        Remember- you will be unplugged from technology and internet for the majority of this retreat.  Organize your affairs in advance so you have nothing to worry about during your time here.  Let people know you will be unplugged so that no one is expecting to hear from you.  During this time, you will be going within and focusing on your relationship with yourself.
        </p>

        <p>
        Reflect:

        The main preparation for an iboga ceremony is simply to focus on becoming aware of you and your life. We recommend that you grab a notebook or a blank piece of paper and draw a line down the center of it. On one side of that line write down all the things you don’t want in your life or want less of in your life, (e.g., no anxiety, less stress). Then in the other column write down what you want in your life or what you want more of in your life (e.g., peace of mind, happiness). Finally, on the back of that paper we will ask you to generate questions around these focal points.
        </p>

        <p>
        State of Mind:

        Finally- to prepare- we recommend coming in to the experience with the following:

        -An open-mind / few expectations:  Iboga works with everyone in a different way, and everyone has a unique experience.  Let go of what you believe Iboga will be like and surrender to being in the present moment with the process as it unfolds for you.

        -Excitement:  Iboga is a great teacher who has helped countless people better their lives.  Be excited for this process!

        “Why do I have anxiety and how do I get rid of it?”

        “How do I not get stressed out over stuff? How do I not get stressed out over  ______?”

        “Why do I not have peace of mind? How can I attain peace of mind?”

        “How can I have more happiness in my life?”

        This process will assist you in having clarity and truth about what matters to you in your life. There will be a point in your ceremony that you will have a chance to directly ask your soul and the medicine these questions.
