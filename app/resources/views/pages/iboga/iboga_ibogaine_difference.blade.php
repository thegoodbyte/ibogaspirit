            <h2>Iboga</h2>
            <p>
                Iboga is the inner root bark of an African shrub called Tabernanthe Iboga.
                The inner root bark is utilized because it contains the highest alkaloid content.
                Tabernanthe Iboga is indigenous to equatorial West Africa, and the Babongo of Southern Gabon were
                the first to discover its medicinal benefits. Iboga continues to be the sacrament of the Bwiti spiritual tradition, where
                it is used for physical healing, spiritual healing, and spiritual discovery in a traditional, ceremonial way.
            </p>

            <p>
                Traditionally, the root bark is ground into a powder and taken in this form,
            </p>

            <p>
                However, it is sometimes consumed as a tea. The Bwiti practitioners use Iboga for initiation rituals,
                ceremonies, mental/physical/spiritual stimulation, healing, spiritual growth, and guidance.
            </p>

            <p>
                This shrub contains at least 12 alkaloids with concentrations up to 6% in the inner root bark, which contributes to its hallucinogenic,
                spiritual, and healing properties. Yet, the essential aspect of its ability to heal is the intelligent spirit it contains.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Ibogaine</h2>
            <p>
            Ibogaine is just one active alkaloid that has been singled out &amp; extracted from Iboga.
            It is used in drug detox facilities under medical supervision because of the potential risks and dangers.
            Ibogaine is able to attach to opiate receptors on the cell wall allowing for safe detoxing and to minimize
            or eliminate withdrawal symptoms from opiate use.
            </p>

            <p>
            Iboga &amp; Ibogaine are both used for addictions and have a 90% success rate. Ibogaine more for substance addictions
            like opiates and heroin, and Iboga more for addictions we have to patterns of behaviours, thoughts, and emotions.
            Iboga is also successful with marijuana, cocaine, and smoking addictions.

            <h3>Total Alkaloid Extract (TA)</h3>
            Total Alkaloid extract (TA), is a reconciliation of the pros and cons of iboga and ibogaine.
            All of the active chemicals (or alkaloids) are extracted from iboga root bark and concentrated, appearing as brown,
            clumped crystals which are often dissolved in a dark solution. <!-- Therapeutic doses range from 2-5 grams. About half of this is ibogaine, but many others are psychoactive too,
            some have very little research, and there are likely others that are totally unknown.
            This means that you get all of these chemicals that may supplement ibogaine, but less of the nausea, physical discomfort,
            or ambiguity of how much of a dose you’re getting with iboga root.-->
<!--
            Many TA users say that it is a significant improvement to the comfort and clarity of their experience.
            Many treatment providers, such as the Iboga Wellness Center of Costa Rica, prefer it due to both its ease of use and deeper psycho-spiritual experience.
            It generally lasts longer than pure ibogaine at 24-36 hours, and it has a slower onset.

            More research is still needed into the many other active ingredients,
            ut anyone who is seeking the full experience of an iboga journey with less of the physical difficulty may benefit from TA.

            <h3>Which Is Right for Me?</h3>

            <p>
                If you are experiencing opiate addiction and withdrawal, pure ibogaine may be best for you due to its
                reputation for completely eliminating addiction withdrawal.<br />
                If you are seeking a full psycho-spiritual experience, you may want to seek out a treatment center using TA.<br />
                If you value tradition, trust in the wisdom of generations of healers, and are ready to undergo discomfort for your journey,<br />
                iboga itself may be the best choice for you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Iboga Root Bark and Iboga TA are much safer
                Nevertheless, using Iboga Root Bark or TA extract is widely considered much safer than Ibogaine alone since
                Noribogaine is the most dangerous metabolite.
            </p>

            <p>
                That’s because keeping the alkaloids such as tabernanthine (13-methoxy ibogamine), ibogamine, and coronaridine enhances
                the effects of Iboga and reduces the need for higher Ibogaine doses.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the same time, using a TA extract allows for dosing that is as precise as using Ibogaine alone while still receiving
                the benefits from all alkaloids and the interactions between them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lower doses of Ibogaine in the system also carry lower risks of side effects. However, in our experience, weight-based dosing of
                Ibogaine which is common in most treatment centers is also not the most optimal approach.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the time we have observed that tolerance and safety towards Iboga and Ibogaine are not related to body weight alone.
            </p>

            <p>
                We recommend dosing in progressive increments based on each individual’s physiological and psychological responses isntead.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>The Spirit of Iboga - Godfather of Plant Medicines</h2>
            <p>
            The most important aspect of a person’s healing is that Iboga’s spirit remains in the medicine.
                This will increase both efficacy and safety.
            </p>

            <p>
            The spirit of Iboga cannot be maintained in the creation of Ibogaine, which is the main reason it is less
                safe and lacks complete spiritual healing. In addition, in most available forms of TA, and even some Root Bark,
                the spirit is lost during extraction or handling.
            </p>

            <p>
            Growing, harvesting, and preparing the Root Bark requires traditional ceremonial practices properly, and
                TA must be made in a particular way to ensure the spirit remains.
            </p>

            <p>
            This is why the right Iboga and properly prepared Iboga TA are much more effective healing tools than Ibogaine.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
            Iboga Root Bark and properly prepared Iboga TA are much safer and more effective than Ibogaine.
            Iboga Root Bark and Iboga TA contain all of the beneficial alkaloids, which have both individual and synergistic benefits,
            enhancing the efficacy of each. Ibogaine is just a single extracted alkaloid. It has even been shown that a few alkaloids,
            such as Ibogamine, have stronger anti-addiction properties. Due to the presence of other alkaloids and the lower
            levels of noribogaine in the body, Iboga Root Bark and Iboga TA are also much safer.
            </p>

            <p>
            However, the presence of Iboga’s spirit is really what makes it superior to Ibogaine. Ibogaine is devoid of this
            and its spiritual and safety benefits.
            </p>
