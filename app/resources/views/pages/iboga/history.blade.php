            <h1>Iboga Plant: History of Use</h1>
                What is Tabernanthe Iboga Plant?
                <p>
                Tabernanthe iboga is a small perennial shrub native to West Africa and used for both medicinal and traditional
                purposes. Its root which contains hallucinogenic properties is a sacrament for the Bwiti and Fang in West
                African countries like Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Iboga plant has small green
                leaves, yellowish-white or pink flowers, and round or oval fruits which are orange in color. On average, its height
                is 4 meters tall, though it can eventually grow up to 10 meters in some very favorable conditions and environments.

                <p>
                Tabernanthe iboga grows in lowland tropical forests, having moist soil in partial shade as its most preferred environment.
                It can be cultivated on light, loamy, and clay soils. If produced from cuttings, the shrubs can start flowering 4 months
                after planting, and as an evergreen shrub, iboga plant often produces fruits all year round. It has around 20 known
                naturally-occurring alkaloids in its leaves, stem bark, seeds, root, and root bark – with its root bark having the
                highest concentration of alkaloids.

            <h2>The Traditional Use of Iboga by Bwiti Practitioners</h2>

            <p>
                The Bwiti, who consider Iboga their main sacrament,  have protected and worked with it for thousands of years.
                This started with the Babongo (also known as Bongo or Pygmies) who created Bwiti, which is now practiced by
                many throughout west Africa. Among other things, the Bwiti people use the Iboga plant to help with pathological
                problems, usher in adulthood, stabilize their community, and promote spiritual growth. One major highlight of
                Bwiti is the initiation ritual when young men and women are given high doses of iboga in a sort of “coming of age” ceremony.
            </p>

            <p>
                The initiation and other Bwiti ceremonies are usually led by a shaman who is a prominent, highly respected member of the
                community. Bwiti spiritual leaders are known as N’ganga and are highly knowledgeable of the various aspects of the Bwiti,
                including botany, physical healing remedies, and spiritual healing practices. After taking iboga, people often experience
                an introspective mindset, which helps in recollecting past experiences and addressing them. It also opens a channel of
                communication to seek information on various issues, from their ancestors and the spirit world. During Bwiti ceremonies,
                a large amount of iboga is taken in different forms. Its various parts could be eaten whole or taken as tea. Though the
                use of Iboga in Bwiti practice started from the Babongo and the Bwiti, it is now also being used by other African tribes
                including the Fang tribes of Cameroon and Congo who have merged Bwiti with Christianity.

            <h2>Iboga in Western Society</h2>
            <p>
                The first use of iboga in the west dates back to around 1899-1900 when some French explorers learned about its effects
                from the Bwiti tribe and then brought it to Europe. Then it was marketed in France as Lambarene and used as a stimulant.
                However, Iboga’s popularity in the western culture rose to prominence in 1962 when Howard Lotsof, from New York discovered
                its anti-addictive properties. Lotsofl was a heroin addict and after ingesting ibogaine, he stopped using it and became
                free of heroin addiction without any withdrawal symptoms.
            </p>

            <p>
                After their experience, researchers and health governing bodies started considering ibogaine as a possible treatment
                for drug addictions. In 1993, the FDA approved the Phase 1 clinical trial of an ibogaine study developed by the National
                Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA). Though NIDA stopped supporting ibogaine research in 1995, the drug’s popularity
                had grown wide among drug advocacy groups and the public in the US and other countries. Though ibogaine is
                listed as illegal in many western countries, including the US, France, Switzerland, and Israel, people from these
                countries travel to other countries to participate in ibogaine ceremonies. Today ibogaine clinics can be found in
                countries like Thailand, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa. In 2009, New Zealand became the first country to accept
                ibogaine as a medication. Also, in 2017, Health Canada added it to the country’s Prescription Drug List (PDL),
                meaning ibogaine can only be gotten legally with a medical prescription.

                Iboga’s Healing Effects on Physical, Mental Conditions and Detox</h2>


                <p>
                    Apart from its traditional spiritual healing effects, iboga plant has also demonstrated efficacy on
                    various psychological and medical conditions. Its main property, ibogaine, is a psychoactive indole alkaloid
                    that exerts its main effects on the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system (CNS) and effects
                    multiple signaling pathways (Dopamine Transporters, N-acetylcholine receptors, Serotonin transporters,
                    NMDA receptors). While we know from a Bwiti standpoint that Iboga is a powerful healer of many things,
                    there have been several benefits proven by scientific studies like, Neuroplasticity, Improving Mood, Helping
                    Trauma, and Treating Depression and anxiety. One exciting new finding is its effectiveness against neurodegenerative
                    conditions such as Parkinson’s. Research shows that ibogaine leads to a significant increase in GDNF (a protein with
                    an exceptionally positive effect on nerve cell growth) levels in the brain. In several animal studies, ibogaine caused
                    significant improvements in animals with Parkinson’s disease, due to its ability to induce GDNF growth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At low doses, ibogaine primarily releases stimulant effects, which increases alertness and reduces fatigue,
                    hunger and thirst. Check out our article on Ibogaine’s Benefits from a Scientific standpoint here.

            <h2>Detox</h2>
            <p>
                Its healing effects have also been tapped for detox of the body, detox from drugs, and mental detox.
                In iboga-assisted detoxification from substance addiction, people can be cured without having any withdrawal symptoms.
                After being metabolized by the body, Ibogaine is converted into a compound called noribogaine, which targets parts of
                the brain affected by addictive behaviors. Noribogaine will then rewire the affected parts and cause a self-restructuring
                process in the brain to a similar state it was before addiction was triggered. Ibogaine has a high 50-80% success rate on
                drug addiction detoxification, making it a more effective option than most conventional drugs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tabernanthe iboga is also an effective drug for the detoxification of the body. The latex obtained from the plant
                contains an anthelmintic property that can help the body expel parasitic worms and other internal parasites.
                It has also been used for ages for mental detoxification. Iboga plant can also be used to treat urinary infections,
                cough, conjunctivitis, and toothache.
            </p>

            <h2>Is Iboga’s Existence Threatened by Massive Harvesting?</h2>

            <p>
                Due to its high efficacy on various conditions, iboga has become one of the most sought-after plant medicines.
                While those who respect its sacred nature cultivate and harvest it with respect and care, some have begun to
                over-harvest it from the wild and sometimes uproot the plant. This has led to a growing concern that iboga may
                become endangered in the near future. Though its sustainability is not yet threatened it could become very scarce in the future.
