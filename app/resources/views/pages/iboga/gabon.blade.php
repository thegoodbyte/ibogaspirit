        <h3>INITIATION INVOLVES TAKING THE IBOGA MEDICINE</h3>
        <p>
            “To initiate into the Bwiti is to have two feet in the tradition; a full commitment to truth, living the truth,
            loving life, knowing yourself, opening your senses, connecting with spirit, communicating with your soul,
            listening to your inner guide.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Bwiti is a spiritual philosophy of introspection and self-discovery, not a religion. Journeyers to Gabon
            will experience an authentic initiation, serving to help break through into an uncharted new phase of life
            and shed aspects of what no longer serves them. Participants report that this experience
            marks the beginning of a huge shift in their lives.
